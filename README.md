# Face_Mask_Detection_YOLOv4

-Masks play an important role in protecting against respiratory diseases, as is one of the
few precautions available for COVID-19. Hence, this project aims to detect a face and
classifies into mask or no mask.

-Many parts of the world have slowed or stopped due to the human, economic, and social impacts of distancing and protection measures.

-This project seeks to create a face mask detection live stream system that can recognize whether people in surveillance-type video streams are correctly wearing their masks using YOLOv4 architecture.
