# Face_Mask_Detection_YOLOv4

-Masks play an important role in protecting against respiratory diseases, as is one of the
few precautions available for COVID-19. Hence, this project aims to detect a face and
classifies into mask or no mask.

-Many parts of the world have slowed or stopped due to the human, economic, and social impacts of distancing and protection measures.

-This project seeks to create a face mask detection live stream system that can recognize whether people in surveillance-type video streams are correctly wearing their masks using YOLOv4 architecture.

## Application of Covid19 Face Mask Detection:
 In the present scenario due to Covid-19, there is no efficient face mask detection
applications. Hence, this application can be deployed in public places to detect a face with
mask or with no mask.
